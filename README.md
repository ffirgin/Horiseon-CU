# Horiseon Clean Up

## Description

This project includes code that was cleaned up of non-semantic HTML elements within the index.html file, repetitive class attributes in the style.css file and overall clutter. My motivation was to understand the importance of semantics within an HTML file, and how cluttered and out of hand it could get with many over-lapping divs. Building out this project allows me to understand the gaps within my learning and focus what I'm able to improve on. I learned that having structure between your different files (HTML and CSS in this project) allows the workflow to be more concise and less room for clutter. Understanding that having more does not always make sense.
